# ChessEnergy

_A rhythmic twist on the classic game of kings._

---

## Concept

**ChessEnergy** transforms traditional chess into a living sea of influence.  
Each piece radiates _energy waves_ that rise and fall with time.  
Power is never constant — it pulses, interferes, and collapses.  
You don’t just out-think your opponent; you out-time them.  
Checkmate isn’t about _position_ anymore — it’s about _rhythm._
